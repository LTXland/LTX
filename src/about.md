# About
LTX is built by [Jordan Reger](https://jordanreger.com) with â™¡ for space, [Deno](https://deno.land), and a whole lot of HTML, CSS, and Markdown. It all started as a project called itslaunchtime in early March 2021. The community grew and grew, eventually reaching 500+ viewers in one day! The project was halted because it became too difficult to manage the whole thing with the small team we had. Now, LTX is coming back stronger than ever with itslaunchtime in its heart. Here's to the future!

Per aspera ad astra.
