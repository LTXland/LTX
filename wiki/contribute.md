### ltxwiki
Contributing to the ltxwiki is simple! All you need to know how to do is write. We use a format called Markdown, commonly used for simple styling of information. Here's a useful guide to get you started:

Next, all you need to do is write! Write about whatever you know. No worries if you make a mistake: surely someone will come around and fix it for you, no harm no foul!

#### Naming your files
Make sure to name your file like `topic.md` in all lowercase. Don't worry about capitalization in the file name, it doesn't matter! All that matters is capitalization in the file. For example:
<br/>
<br/>

`starship.md`

```
# Starship
This is a page about Starship. Read all about it!
```
<br/>
It's that simple!
